# Celebal Cloud Computing Internship: Weekly Tasks

## Week 1: Network Models and Protocols Blog Series

### Task:
Explain the foundational networking concepts, including the OSI model, TCP/IP model, and a comparison of key protocols (TCP vs UDP).

---

## Week 2: Addressing and Protocols Blog Series

### Task:
Explain the core concepts of IP and MAC addressing along with their associated protocols (ARP & RARP).

---

## Week 3: Virtual Machine

### Task:
How to create and deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) within a Virtual Network (VNet) using Azure while leveraging resource management best practices?

---

## Week 4: Setting Up Virtual Network Peering in Azure

### Task:
How can you set up Virtual Network Peering in Azure, create virtual networks, and deploy virtual machines within peered networks to ensure seamless communication?

---

## Week 5: Setting Up Three-Tier Architecture in Azure with Network Security Groups (NSGs)

### Task:
Create a network infrastructure with three distinct tiers (Web, App, DB) in Azure. Configure communication rules between the tiers and set up internet access for only the Web tier. Deploy virtual machines (VMs) in each tier (both Linux and Windows), configure Apache on Linux VMs, and IIS on Windows VMs.

---

## Week 6: Create an Internal & External Load Balancer in Azure

### Task:
Create both an internal and an external load balancer in Azure to manage traffic. Ensure they are correctly configured and verified to balance traffic across multiple Virtual Machines (VMs).

---

## Week 7: Create Site-to-Site VPN Peering in Azure

### Task:
Create a Site-to-Site VPN connection in Azure to securely connect an on-premises network to an Azure Virtual Network (VNet). This includes setting up the virtual network, VPN gateway, and local network gateway to enable secure traffic flow between both environments.

---

## Week 8: Configuration of On-Premises to Hub and Spoke Connectivity Using S2S Tunneling

### Task:
The task involves configuring on-premises to hub and spoke connectivity using Site-to-Site (S2S) tunneling from on-premises and hub-and-transit VNet peering from the hub to the spoke. You will configure Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) on the on-premises VM and establish S2S connectivity to the hub. The on-premises VM should be able to ping both the hub VM and the spoke VM successfully. The connectivity should be bi-directional, and there should be no direct connectivity between the spoke and the on-premises VNet.
