# **Week 2: Addressing and Protocols Blog Series**

### **Task:**  
Explain the core concepts of IP and MAC addressing along with their associated protocols (ARP & RARP).

### **Answer:**  

#### **1. Understanding IP Addresses**  
IP addresses serve as the primary identifiers for devices on a network, enabling communication by specifying the source and destination of data packets.  
Key Points:  
- **IPv4:** A 32-bit address format, commonly represented as `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`, where each `xxx` ranges from 0 to 255.  
  - Structured into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E.  
  - Widely used but limited in address availability.  
- **IPv6:** A 128-bit address format designed to address the limitations of IPv4.  
  - Supports virtually unlimited addresses.  
  - Includes features like improved security and simplified header structure.

#### **2. MAC Addressing and the Role of ARP & RARP**  
A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a hardware identifier assigned to network interfaces, ensuring unique identification at the data link layer.  
- **MAC Address:** A 48-bit address (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).  
  - Permanent and hardware-specific.  
  - Used within a local area network (LAN).  

**Associated Protocols:**  
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):**  
  Translates logical IP addresses into physical MAC addresses, allowing devices to locate one another on a network.  
- **RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol):**  
  Performs the reverse of ARP by mapping MAC addresses to IP addresses.
